    <h3>Initiation</h3>
    <p>
        I belong to a nuclear family. I was born and brought up in Chandigarh India. Currently, I am doing
        masters from the <strong>University of Windsor</strong> in <em>Masters of applied computing</em>. My hobbies are
        playing cricket,
        swimming, trekking, playing video games, spending time with my friends and family.
        If I talk about my studies, honestly I was never good at it as a kid I always wanted to spend my time
        playing cricket even when I went to high school I was focused on cricket. Instantly, from nowhere I
        decided to take Bachelors of Engineering in my undergrad. While studying undergrad I know that I was not
        good at studies and I was scared what will I do when it comes to programming how will I score but I
        helped my self to sneak out from code loopholes and get passed in the exams. However, when my bachelor's
        were going to finish I got to know that I have an interest in developing a mobile application and in the
        last semester I attended 3 months of COOP as an android developer there I learned how real-world
        applications are developed.
